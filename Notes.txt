This is where I will write down any notes:

Date: 5/13/25
- Today we started to look into learning Spring Boot and found about spring.academy
- we will be creating a cash card system:
    * use Spring Boot, which is built on top of spring
    * This project will be for a Web Application
    * Allow parents to manage allowances
    * use Spring Initializr
        - Gradle - Groovy
        - Java
        - Dependencies (WIP as we go):
            * Spring Web

- some annotations that I have seen being used
    - JacksonTester is a convenience wrapper to the Jackson JSON parsing library. It handles serialization and deserialization of JSON objects.
    - @Autowired is an annotation that directs Spring to create an object of the requested type.
