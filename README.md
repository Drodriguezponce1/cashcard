The goal of the course was to create a Cash Card Ecosystem using SpringBoot

Some notable technologies:
- RESTful API
- Spring Framework
- JDBC or any DB connection

- we will be creating a cash card system:
    * use Spring Boot, which is built on top of spring
    * This project will be for a Web Application
    * Allow parents to manage allowances
    * use Spring Initializr
        - Gradle - Groovy
        - Java
        - Dependencies (WIP as we go):
